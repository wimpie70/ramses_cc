    STORAGE_VERSION stays at 1 — the store format hasn't changed.
    The Phase 3a command migration (remotes → schema _commands) is
    handled at runtime by the coordinator's ``_sync_remotes_to_schema``,
    not by a storage version bump.  The Phase 4 known_list removal is
    handled by the config entry migration (``async_migrate_entry`` in
    ``__init__.py``), not by the store — known_list was never stored
    in .storage, it lived in the config entry options.

    ``max_readable_version`` is set to 2 so that .storage files written
    by the earlier (briefly-released) v2 code can still be loaded.  The
    migration function is a no-op identity — the v2 data format is
    identical to v1, so no transformation is needed.  After loading, the
    data is saved back as v1.

    Downgrade safety: 0.58.0/0.58.1 have ``STORAGE_VERSION = 1`` and
    don't set ``max_readable_version``, so they can read v1 files (what
    we write).  They cannot read v2 files, but since we now write v1,
    this is not a problem.
